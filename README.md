- 📫 How to reach me ...: fill a equus asinus skull with 153 tungsten beads, must be at least 99.99981% pure, beads must be 0.004 (±0.0000012) meters in diameter. and carefully shake it in a solar eclipse while diamond ring effect at third contact takes place, not dropping a single bead. make sure you also have a source of sound available and it should also be playing the exact frequency as the human teeth number 8. other stuff you should know about is you must have the 8th teeth. the sound source should make at least 90 decibels of sound. and also you should be a human. these measures are taken for my security. if you dont have the expenses to contact me then be gone mortal. i am probably busy making a space-time crystal salad.
